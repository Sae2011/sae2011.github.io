    <h1>Séréna A. Emmou</h1>

    <h2>My academic plans</h2>
    <p>I study Computer Science at the University of Miami. I also plan to double major in French. I am hoping to attend law school after completing my B.A in Computer Science and French to practice IP Tech law and/or immigration law. </p>

    <h2>My professional plans</h2>
    <p>When I'm finally done with school, I'm planning on practicing law to eventually become a judge. But in the meantime, I have philanthropic goals that I would like to see come true. I want to continue my work with the Red Cross and eventually create my own organization.</p>

    <h2>Dream travel destinations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</li>
        <li>Dakar, Senegal</li>
        <li>Nairobi, Kenya</li>
    </ul>
